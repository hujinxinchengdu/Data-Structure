# Data-Structure
Implement important data structures to use java for your reference

In the code I will add:

Dynamic array automatic expansion scheme

Prevent complexity shocks

Comparison of multiple implementations of queues and stacks

In-depth understanding of recursion from the linked list

Playing tree structure from binary search tree

Collection class for different implementations, mapping class

Actual case based on text word frequency statistics

Red and black trees, understand the meaning of the balanced binary tree

Priority queue and heap

Line segment application

Trie realizes high-speed address book inquiry

And check the five versions of the performance step by step optimization
